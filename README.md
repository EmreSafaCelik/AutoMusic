# Auto Music Starter (Kotlin Android App)

Welcome to the repository of the Auto Music Starter, a Kotlin-based Android app designed to enhance your music listening experience, especially while driving. Crafted with convenience and safety in mind, this app facilitates a seamless music setup as soon as you connect to your preferred Bluetooth devices.

## Story Behind the App

As someone who often forgot to start music before hitting the road, I found myself scrambling to play my favorite tunes while driving, waiting for opportune moments in traffic or at lights to hurriedly start Spotify. I realized that this not only disrupted my peace but also posed a safety risk. Thus, the concept of the Auto Music Starter was born, aiming to automate the music setup process and let the music flow without any manual intervention, adding safety and convenience to my drives.

## Features

### Automatic Spotify Startup

The cornerstone feature of this app is the automatic activation of Spotify when your device connects to specified Bluetooth devices. Based on your preferences, it starts playing music from the point where you left off or any given URL (which can specify lists or songs), ensuring a personalized music experience right from the start.

### Welcoming Audio Message

Before kicking off your music session, the app greets you with a warm audio message saying "Welcome sir" in Turkish ("Ho≈ügeldiniz efendim"). In future updates, I plan to allow customization of this welcome message to make it even more personal.

### Future Plans

In the roadmap, there is a plan to integrate YT Music support to broaden the app's compatibility and offer more choices for users in terms of the music platforms they wish to use.
